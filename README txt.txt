A Java school project.
Contains a Spring Boot MVC web application and a Rest API.

1 execution of the project

This is an online application in which you can not only plan a trip but also saves your favorite trips to your local storage.
The trips that have been saved can be loaded in by simply clicking on the trip on the index page.
After you have either selected your favorite trip or entered your destination and start point you will be redirected to the information page.
Here you will be presented with several trips from which you can choose to reach your destination.
After selecting a trip you will be shown the information about this trip.
The application is meant to stimulate people to choose for more eco friendly ways of travel.
Therefore the trip information will also include a notification which will show you if there are more eco friendly ways of travel to your current destination.
For now there are only two ways of travel available in the application from which you can choose to plan your trip (Train and bus).
There are plans to add more options to the project like being able to travel by bike and by foot but for now these options are not yet available in the application.
